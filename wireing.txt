PWR_KEY seems to work like chip select that can be used from the MCU
If connected to VCC Radio start immediately

For testing via minicom the power button can be used instead.

Note!
It's very important to initiiate autobaud corretly. Seems like 
use of modem init sequence is working. 

For minicom:

W+--------------------[Modem and dialing parameter setup]---------------------+
 |                                                                            |
O| A - Init string ......... AT^M                                             |
